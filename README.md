# Premium AI Domains For Sale

This project is a website that showcases a curated list of premium AI domains for sale. The website is designed to help users find and purchase valuable digital real estate in the rapidly growing field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is built with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Domain Listing:** The website displays a list of premium AI domains for sale, featuring the domain name, price, and a short description. Users can easily browse through the available domains and find the perfect one for their needs.

- **Sorting and Filtering:** Users can sort the domain list by name or price, making it easier to find domains that fit their preferences. Additionally, the website provides a search functionality to allow users to search for specific domains by name.

- **TLD Filtering:** The website includes a feature to filter domains based on their Top-Level Domain (TLD). Users can click on the TLD tags to view domains with specific extensions such as .ai, .com, .app, etc.

- **Sharing Functionality:** Each domain listing includes a share button that allows users to easily share the domain on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Users can also copy the direct link to the domain for sharing purposes.

- **Buy Now and Make an Offer:** Each domain listing includes "Buy Now" and "Make an Offer" links, enabling users to proceed with the purchase or negotiate the price directly with the domain owner.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
4. If no domains appear you may not have a domains.json file. I used [porkbun-domains-data-extractor](https://github.com/ericbuess/porkbun-domains-data-extractor) to extract my domains and generate the domains.json and domains.jsonld files.

- **styles.css:** The CSS file that contains the styles for the website.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the website, including sorting, filtering, searching, and sharing.
- **domains.json:** A JSON file that contains the data for the available AI domains, including the domain name, price, and description.
